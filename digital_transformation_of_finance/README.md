## Digital Transformation of Finance: Decentralization, Accessibility and Efficiency

### Abstract

Organizations such as institutions and large companies have to adapt to technological advances. They do this through a digital transformation process. In this paper we concentrate on finance industry which entered the first stage of digital transformation already in the 1960s. We look at the effects of digital transformation on finance with a particular emphasis on decentralization, accessibility and efficiency of novel approaches. First we establish a circular pattern of technological development and look at finance through that framework. Then we look into the process of digital transformation itself and how finance industry progressed through the stages of transformation, i.e. digitization, digitalization and digital transformation stage. Finally, we examine more closely two case studies: (1) possibility of decentralized and efficient real time transaction networks and (2) peer-to-peer lending, which allows individuals to offer loans to each other.
